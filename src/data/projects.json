We decided to create a board that would include a E220-900T22S LoRa module and be portable. We also included a connector for a LiPo battery to be recharged using the USB-C from the microcontroller. We decided to stick with a rechargeable solution since we arenâ€™t certain about how much power it draws. LoRa range is around 10km which allows for greater coverage and no need for GPS. The goal was to maximize battery while keeping a slim and comfortable profile for a pet."
